\title{Double demeaning estimator with proxy regressions with treatment and outcome learners}
\usage{
DDPRcomb(
  Y,
  Z,
  X,
  interZ = formula(~1),
  ID,
  data,
  library = c("glm", "deeplearning"),
  crossFitting = FALSE,
  K = 5,
  mCrossFit = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{continuous outcome variable}

\item{Z}{binary treatment indicator, 1 - treatment, 0 - control}

\item{X}{vector, matrix, or dataframe containing measured confounders}

\item{interZ}{formula that contains the variables that "interact"  with the treatment. "1" will be always added. The default is no interaction, i.e., formula = formula(~1).}

\item{ID}{cluster identifier}

\item{data}{dataframe containing the variables in the model}

\item{library}{character vector of prediction algorithms. The available methods are  glm, deeplearning, gbm, and randomForests. The default methods are glm and deeplearning.}

\item{crossFitting}{whether to do cross fitting. The default is FALSE, and currently it is not available.}

\item{K}{number of folds. The default is 5, and currently it is not available.}

\item{mCrossFit}{number of cross fitting. The default is FALSE, and currently it is not available.}
}
\value{
the weights/coefficients of ensemble learners, estimates and standard errors, treatment predictions, and outcome predictions
