Description: A family of machine learning (ML) estimators for handling cluster-level 
  unmeasured confounders in R. It provides a general approach to estimate causal effects
  in the presence of cluster-level unmeasured confounders in multilevel observational data.
  In particular, we leverage modern ML methods and exploit a fundamental nature regarding
  cluster-level unmeasured confounders to estimate the conditional average treatment effect
  (CATE) and the average treatment effect (ATE).
