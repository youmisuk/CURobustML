Description: A family of machine learning estimators for handling unmeasured cluster-level confounders in R. It provides a general approach to estimate causal effects in the presence of cluster-level unmeasured confounders in multi-level observational data. In particular, we leverage modern ML methods and exploit a fundamental nature regarding cluster-level unmeasured confounders to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and the average treatment effect (ATE).
